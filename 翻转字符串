翻转字符串

先把字符串转化成数组，再借助数组的reverse方法翻转数组顺序，最后把数组转化成字符串。

你的结果必须得是一个字符串

当你完成不了挑战的时候，记得开大招'Read-Search-Ask'。

这是一些对你有帮助的资源:

Global String Object
String.split()
Array.reverse()
Array.join()




function reverseString(str) {
  // 请把你的代码写在这里
  return str.split("").reverse().join("");
}

reverseString("hello");

Code Explanation:
Our goal is to take the input, str, and return it in reverse. Our first step is to split the string by characters using split(''). Notice that we don't leave anything in between the single quotes, this tells the function to split the string by each character.

Using the split() function will turn our string into an array of characters, keep that in mind as we move forward.

Next we chain the reverse() function, which takes our array of characters and reverses them.

Finally, we chain join('') to put our characters back together into a string. Notice once again that we left no spaces in the argument for join, this makes sure that the array of characters is joined back together by each character.
